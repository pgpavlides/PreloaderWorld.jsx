📖 This repository contains a collection of preloaders that you can use in your projects. 

⚠️Everything is under heavy development.⚠️

A preloader is a visual element that is displayed to the user while the content of a website or application is being loaded. 
They provide users with feedback that the page is still loading, which can help to improve user experience.


## 📺 Acknowledgements

Many of the preloaders are created from Youtube content creators.
All of these amazing people that share their knowledge with everyone for free.
Make sure you check their channel and give them some love!

## 🕹️ Demo

Demo is currently not functional. ( Will be up as soon as the interface is done )

## 🌈 Color Reference

Inside the project you will find **_colors.scss**. This is a variable scss file that contains a pallete of 137 colors. You can use them when you create your own Preloader!


## 🚧 Roadmap

- **Add more preloaders**: rmY goal is to create a comprehensive collection of preloaders that you can use in your projects. I will be adding more preloaders to the repository on a regular basis, so be sure to check back often for updates.

- **Improve documentation**: I want to make it as easy as possible for you to use the preloaders in your projects and for you to learn CSS & SASS. I will be improving the documentation and adding more examples to help you get started and understand the basics of how to create your own preloader. 

- **Create a community**: I believe that sharing knowledge and resources is key to the success of any project. I want to create a community around this repository where you can share your own preloaders, ask for help, or give feedback.

- **Create a Discord Server**
